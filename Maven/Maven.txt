A build tool is a software utility that automates the process of compiling source code into binary code, packaging the binaries, running tests, and creating documentation, among other tasks. These tools are essential for managing and streamlining the development process, especially in larger projects.

Maven
=====
Maven is a popular build tool in the Java ecosystem. Here's what it typically does:

Project Management: Maven uses a Project Object Model (POM) file to manage project configuration. This file contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.

Dependency Management: Maven automatically downloads and manages libraries and dependencies required by your project. It handles transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies) as well.

Build Automation: Maven automates the process of compiling source code, running tests, packaging the application into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR), and deploying it.

Lifecycle Management: Maven defines a set of build lifecycles, each consisting of different build phases. For example, the default lifecycle includes phases like validate, compile, test, package, verify, install, and deploy.

Plugins: Maven's functionality can be extended through plugins, which can perform tasks such as compiling code, testing, packaging, and deploying.

Example of Maven Workflow
POM File: You define your project's dependencies, plugins, and build configurations in a pom.xml file.
Dependencies: Maven reads the pom.xml file, downloads necessary libraries, and maintains a local repository of these libraries.
Build: You run Maven commands (e.g., mvn clean install) to compile the code, run tests, and package the application.
Result: Maven produces the desired output, such as a JAR file, which can be deployed or distributed.

Common Maven Commands
mvn clean: Cleans the project by removing the target directory where the build outputs are stored.
mvn compile: Compiles the source code of the project.
mvn test: Runs the tests for the project.
mvn package: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format, such as a JAR file.
mvn install: Installs the package into the local repository, which can be used as a dependency in other projects locally.
mvn deploy: Deploys the package to a remote repository for sharing with other developers.

Maven simplifies project setup, dependency management, and build processes, making it easier for developers to manage complex Java projects.
